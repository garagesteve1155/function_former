If you would like to support this free project and Making Made Easy, please consider becoming a member of our Patreon at https://patreon.com/MakingMadeEasy

Automatic generation, testing, and editing of code through the use of ChatGPT (Others to come).
Takes almost all the hassle out of using ChatGPT to help with coding tasks.

Upgrades coming soon:
- Allow ChatGPT to edit or add individual lines and blocks instead of regenerating the whole code
- Save code from each attempt to its own file in case you liked something you saw during dev that you want to use later
- ChatGPT controlled terminal commands for downloading any necessary files, packages, libraries, etc (User has final yes or no say on whether the command executes or not)
- Automated internet research when stuck
